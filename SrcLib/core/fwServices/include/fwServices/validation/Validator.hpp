 * \li Checking that service to object association are compliant
 * \li Checking that both object and service configurations are valid (concern class attributes) with respect to XSD schema (warning when no XSD is provided)
 *
 * @note Validation can be completely performed on the base of the component distribution, without preloading or linking with dynamic libraries implementing classes.
