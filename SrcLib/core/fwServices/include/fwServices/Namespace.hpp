/**
 * @brief Namespace fwServices is dedicated to (mimic) the dynamic affectation of methods to (pure data) objects (::fwTools::Object), and component orientation transparently. This is assimilable to the
 * notion of role (corresponding to the IService class).
 * \li IService : API to normalize manipulation, using a limited set of well defined methods
 * \li IService : contract for service implementation
 * \li macros.hpp : declaration of service to object bindings
 * \li A set of high level methods to facilitate the use of implemented concepts (Add.hpp, New.hpp, Info.hpp, Erase.hpp, Get.hpp and Run.hpp)
 * \li ObjectMsg and IEditionService : communication management (implementation of an adaptation of the observer design pattern), high-level methods being available in Com.hpp
 * @namespace   fwServices
 *
 * @date        2009-2010.
