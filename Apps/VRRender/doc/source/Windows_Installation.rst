Windows Installation
====================

.. index:: Installation


Installing VR-Planning is easy. Under Windows, the automatic install file
``VR-Planning_n.msi`` starts with a double click on its icon. It starts a 5 step
process where you will have to ``accept the terms in the license agreement``.
It will further be possible to select the folder where the software will be
installed. Indeed, the default folder can be avoid if you do not have the
access right. In such a case, select a personal folder to install VR-Planning.
After the final validation window, the setup software then installs VR-Planning
on your computer and its icons on your desktop and it asks you for a last click
on the finish button. The installation is completed.
