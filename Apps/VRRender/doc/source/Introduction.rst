VR-Planning is an IRCAD Surgical Planning Software working on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It allows to visualize 3D models of patients reconstucted from their DICOM Image by IRCAD R&D team, and also to virtually cut these models by providing an automatic volume and pourcentage computation. Three kinds of visualization are possible : 3D model visualization, 2D Dicom visualization and 3D Dicom direct volume rendering. You can also use VR-Planning to visualize your own DICOM medical images of patients in 2D or in 3D thanks to the user friendly direct volume rendering. However, this VR-Planning is not CE-marked or FDA-approved for clinical use. IRCAD plans to obtain such marks in the future and then will provide a new not limited version including new options that you can propose. Do not hesitate to provide your remarks on the possible options and services that could be integrated in the future.
