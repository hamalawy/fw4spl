Export and Close data
=====================

.. index:: Export Data

The file menu contains two useful export options. The first ``export selected patient`` option allows to record a selected patient in a VR-Planning format. It will include the distance measurement, the landmark positioning, the transfer function of the direct volume rendering, and the planned operation integratin the cutting planes position. The second ``export slices (jpg)`` option allows to record, in a selected folder, all DICOM slices of the selected image in a jpeg format.

The file menu also contains two options allowing to close opened patient data. The ``Close all patients`` option will close all patients data and the ``Close selected image`` will only close the image seleted in the ``series selector`` window.
